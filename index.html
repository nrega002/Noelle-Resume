        Marketing and communications appeals to me because I have a passion for art and business. I believe that this major offers me a competative edge because it encompases two important aspects of buisness. Communications can enable me to present my ideas in a clear and concise manner, while marketing teaches me how to advertise to a broader audience. A marketing background will also provide me with the skills to analyze and interpret statistical data. I eventually plan on transferring into a post graduate MBA program, and I believe that this major will properly prepare me for such a time. My long term goal is to one day become an entrepreneur and bring opportunities to the less fortunate.I am currently a first year Pre-Business student at UCR and working at a Thai restaurant in multiple positions four days a week. While I lack extensive business experience, I am slowly growing my repertoire of knowledge. 
I believe that investing and guiding new businesses in third world countries could be essential to development. These businesses have the potential to not only be a source of income for citizens, but also a source of revenue for community projects such as building wells and improving roads.The projects can be tailored, so that they are successful with the resources that they have and utilize the skills that make the region unique. The goods produced by these businesses can be traded internationally, spreading some of that communityÂ´s unique culture throughout the world.This may have the added benefit of encouraging tourism, which can further promote economic prosperity. Consumers and producers alike will be encouraged by the impact that they are making. Additionally, these businesses can be models for future projects. They would have wages appropriate to the region, good working conditions and promote individual and social development. Businesses can start out as being managed by the investors and foreign business professionals, but local employees can rise in ranking and eventually buy out the investors. The key is that the businesses are successful enough that they promote economic growth, and encourage investors to provide financial support into more small foreign communities. 
	This is one of my many dreams of how we can start chiseling away at issues that hold humanity back from reaching its potential. It is natural to have flaws, but as mankind progresses it is our job to move forward. I am privileged to say that I have never felt the pains of starvation  or the insecurities of homelessness, but I have witnessed the incomprehensible demoralization that is all too real even in the land of plenty. I can not begin to fathom the hardships in less developed countries that provide little to no social welfare, resulting in rampant infant mortality and disease. I did not grow up with an abundance of financial wealth, yet comparatively I live in luxury worlds away from many. It is too easy to turn a blind eye. I recognize that I have an abundance of  privileges that I want to extend to others. My ideas may be over simplified and underdeveloped, but this is why I want to further my education and purpose in life. 
<br><br>

        Overall, If I were to title the story of my life it would be Â¨The Endless Road to Self-improvementÂ¨, not because I am not proud of my progress, but rather because throughout my life there will always be room for growth. I am extremely self driven, and my life has been a testament to that. There have been ups and downs, but with every complication or misfortune has come growth. I am not one to sit back when they are pushed down, but rather use the opportunity for self-improvement. The road that is my life has had beautiful scenery even in the worst of times. Like a road, life can have twists and turns, bumps and holes, but a smooth road never made a skilled driver.
